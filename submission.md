## **Inspiration**

Fully leverage NFT on the ICON blockchain, a promising dapp to drive network adoption 

## **What it does**

A combination of 

- **NFT Card Game**

    Each race car is in the form of a card, card data is broken into two separate sets. On-chain data for immutable unique records and represented ownership. Off-chain data for user controlled properties such as sale price, car description, listing status etc. A garage to store your car collectibles, each collectible can be traded in the market place.

- **NFT RPG Game**

    Build a garage of your dream cars. Each car can also go through a series of upgrades for enhanced performance (more improvements in future updates). This game is about racing cars across a variety of roads and tracks, taking corners or rubber burning drag races! 

- **NFT Marketplace**

   Every owner can list their cars for sale in a central market place, paid in ICX with the ICONex wallet. Collectors can buy and trade from the market place to build their dream garage. Owners can write their own descriptions for the sale item (mutable data).

## **How I built it**

ICON technologies include - payment via ICONex chrome extension integration, icon_services via Python SDK, ICX USD price data via BAND oracle, custom SCORE via NFT token standard
Web technologies include - HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and several bundled frameworks

## **Challenges I ran into**

We had limited time and resources for the hackathon, building a comprehensive game requires more time and effort, it was difficult to balance. We already have plenty of ideas on how to make this game better, however for this hackathon we decided to demonstrate NFT use case with deep ICON integration. 

## **Accomplishments that I'm proud of**

We tried to demonstrate our proficient knowledge of ICON technology stack by utilizing many core components throughout the application life cycle. This starts off from frontend interactions with ICONex chrome extension, on-chain queries, hybrid data models to ensure data integrity for both mutable and immutable data. Extended SCORE implementation of the IRC3 NFT token standard. We also successfully integrated the BAND oracle for external price feeds. With everything stitched together, this sets a great usage example of ICON NFT for the new devs to come.

## **What I learned**

Many things. Particularly the core service layer of the ICON blockchain, as well as SCORE deployment methodologies, testing and auditing, external oracle integration.

## **What's next for ICON GT**

If this game wins the hackathon, we'll continue to extend it to a full scale NFT-based dapp game, comparable to cryptokitties with even more enticing features. 

1) **Extending the game play**
    - Include card battles on different tracks, with story mode (single-player) and multi-player mode.
    - Overall improvement of design with original art works and animation
    - Incorporate common elements from existing race games. Cities, tracks, events, challenges etc
    - Sound effects

2) **Community**
    - Social features 
    - Community building
    - Campaigns
    - Personal profiles
    - Car talk chatroom/forum

3) **Addictiveness**
    - Feed the ego features: local leader board, global leader board, trophies and accomplishments, sharable profiles with garage content, player stats etc.
    - Strategizing game play that require skill: more built-in properties for roads and tracks, weather conditions, even more car upgrades.
    - Activity rewards: check-in rewards, play rewards, winning rewards, gift shops to spend the rewards

4) **Mobile**
    - Native mobile apps (iOS, Android) of the application
    - Mobile friendly responsive web app

The ultimate goal is to build a fully functional and addictive dapp to showcase NFT being properly used on the ICON blockchain. With sufficient funding in place and our continual development, we believe this game can become a flagship product for the ICON network.
